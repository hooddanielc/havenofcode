Haven of Code.. Coming Soon
===========

Source code for the haven of code website. The source code runs off of a basic LAMP server, with no complicated configuration at the moment. I'm not currently using a mysql database, but will. To get up and running fast, I recommend using this [guide](https://gist.github.com/hooddanielc/9752487) to set up a vm. Then put the source code in your LAMP's www folder.

Website is in full remodel mode and there will not be a regular release cycle for some time.

happy coding
