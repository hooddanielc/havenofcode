Haven of Code
=============

Care about the Haven of Code website and want to help out?

This is how you get started with the code. The source code runs off of a basic LAMP server, with not much complicated configuration, except for the the github application. To get up and running fast, I recommend using this [guide](https://gist.github.com/hooddanielc/9752487) to set up a vm and setting up a github application [here](https://developer.github.com). Once you have a github-application and LAMP vm set up just edit the config.php and make a database corresponding to the name given in config.php.

Thanks for helping and,

Happy coding :-)
